# WG API Sharp library #

## Description ##
**[WG API Sharp](https://github.com/just0rz/wg-api-sharp-library/wiki/WGAPISharp)** is a library which should help people using .Net/C# to interact with WarGaming [API](http://wargaming.net/developers/).  
For the moment the main target is to cover all methods exposed related to World of Tanks, but in the future(when I'm fully happy with it) I will extend it to support the rest too.  
  
For more details about the roadmap, etc. I use the [wiki](https://github.com/just0rz/wg-api-sharp-library/wiki). I never used github until now, so I'm learning as I go. :)

## Project status ##

<font color='orange'><b>Beta launched</b></font>

For the moment I have released a beta version. I have covered most of the API exposed methods. I feel that future changes should not shake the entities too much.

## 3<sup>rd</sup> party ##
The tools used to develop the library:
  * Visual Studio 2012(home)
  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
  * [Git Extensions](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/)
  * [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)
  * [Json.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json)
  * <del>[Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/)</del>

## Disclaimer ##
I am in no way affiliated with [WarGaming](https://github.com/just0rz/wg-api-sharp-library/wiki/WarGaming) company. I have only created a wrapper for the original [API](http://wargaming.net/developers/).
