# WG API Sharp library #

## Description ##
**[WG API Sharp](WGAPISharp)** library is, as its name suggests, a library which helps people who use C# to interact with WarGaming [API](http://wargaming.net/developers/).

## 3<sup>rd</sup> party ##
The tools used to develop the library:
  * Visual Studio 2012(home)
  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
  * [Git Extensions](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/)
  * [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)
  * [Json.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json)
  * [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) - <strong>NO LONGER</strong> since moved to github

## Disclaimer ##
I am in no way affiliated with [WarGaming](WarGaming) company. This library can be considered like a wrapper over the original [API](http://wargaming.net/developers/). I have only made it easier for people to access it.
